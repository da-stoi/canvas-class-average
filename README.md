### What is it?
__Canvas Class Average__ is a *Chrome Extension* that calculates a class average for a Canvas course.

### How does it work?
After installing the extension, simply navigate to the grades page of a Canvas course. The extension will automatically calculate the class average and display it on the page under your score in the course.

### Things to note
- The average may not be 100% accurate, especially if your teacher/professor doesn't use Canvas correctly. 
- It **does not** account for class curving, or any other special grading rules besides assignment group weights.(Assignment weights only work if your teacher/professor has them set up through Canvas.)
- The extension will not work if your teacher/professor has assignment averages hidden.
